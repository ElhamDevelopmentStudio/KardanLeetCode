## **Testing**

Testing is a critical part of the development process, ensuring the reliability, security, and usability of the Kardan Programming Competition platform.

### **Unit Testing**

- **Jest**: Utilized for writing unit tests in the front-end, ensuring that individual components and functions work as expected.
- **PyTest**: A powerful tool for writing and executing tests in the back-end, including database models, business logic, and API endpoints.

### **Integration Testing**

- **Selenium**: For automated web application testing, ensuring that different parts of the application work together seamlessly.
- **Django Test Client**: Part of Django's standard library, allowing for simulation of HTTP requests to test views and integration with the back-end.

### **Continuous Integration and Deployment**

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing by running test suites on every commit and pull request, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Jenkins**: For automating the deployment process, including running tests, building the application, and deploying to production servers.

### **Security and Performance Testing**

- **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: Identifies security vulnerabilities in the web application, ensuring that it is secure against common security threats.
- **Load Testing Tools (e.g., JMeter)**: Simulates high traffic on the application to test its performance under stress, ensuring it remains responsive and stable.

Testing strategies are implemented at every stage of the development lifecycle, from individual units and components to the integrated platform, encompassing both functionality and security. This comprehensive approach to testing ensures that the Kardan Programming Competition platform delivers a flawless user experience, maintaining its integrity and reliability.
