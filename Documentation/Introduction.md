## 1. Introduction

### Project Name

Kardan Programming Competition

### Purpose

The Kardan Programming Competition web application is a specialized platform designed to facilitate programming contests for students. It serves as a dynamic environment for hosting, participating in, and managing programming challenges, with a focus on coding competencies. This platform encourages competitive programming by allowing students to solve problems through a built-in editor and ranks their performances, thereby fostering a sense of achievement and competition.

### Core Functionality

- **Challenge Hosting and Participation**: Admins can upload programming questions, and students can participate by solving these questions using a built-in editor, leveraging the Monaco Editor integrated with React.
- **Leaderboard Mechanics**: Participants' performances are ranked on an integrated leaderboard, promoting a competitive atmosphere.
- **User Authentication and Profile Management**: Features two types of authentications: one for admins and one for students, ensuring secure login and profile management.
- **Technology Stack**: The application is built using React, JSX, and CSS, providing a modern and interactive web experience for tech-savvy students interested in coding challenges.

### Target Audience

This platform specifically targets students who are eager to enhance their programming skills through competition and challenges, as well as administrators looking to organize and manage programming contests efficiently.
