## **Architecture**

The Kardan Programming Competition platform is built on a modern, scalable architecture designed to handle multiple users and complex operations efficiently. Below is an overview of the system architecture:

### **Frontend**

- **Framework**: React.js is used for building the user interface, offering a dynamic and responsive experience for users.
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, and CSS3 are the core technologies, with JSX for templating and Emotion for styled components.
- **Libraries**: Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material UI for UI components; Monaco Editor for the coding environment; Axios for HTTP requests; and Nivo for data visualization.

### **Backend**

- **Framework**: Django, a high-level Python web framework, powers the backend. It provides a clean, pragmatic design tailored for fast development.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, offering robust features and reliability for storing user data, contest information, and question banks.
- **Authentication**: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, scalable user authentication.
- **API**: Django Rest Framework for building a RESTful API, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.

### **Infrastructure**

- **Containerization**: Docker for isolating the application environment, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins for automating the deployment process, from code updates to production deployment.

### **Design Principles**

- **Microservices Architecture**: The backend is structured as a collection of microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality. This approach enhances the scalability and maintainability of the system.
- **Atomic Design Methodology**: Frontend components are organized following the atomic design principles, promoting reusability and systematic development.
- **Security First**: Emphasizing security at every layer of the application, from secure coding practices to regular vulnerability assessments.

This architecture ensures that the Kardan Programming Competition platform is not only performant and reliable but also scalable and secure, capable of supporting a growing user base and evolving features.
